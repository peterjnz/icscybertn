## Members
The NZ ICS Cyber TN is made up of members from across NZ (with some international members with an interest in NZ OT security).  Various backgrounds including IT and ICS professionals.  Owner/operators as well as vendors and service providers. Various industries including both critical (CNI) and non-critical industrial organisations.  The forum has a technical focus (not non-technical/ management focus).  Most members have a good understanding of OT principals (skip the basics).

## Typical Forum Agenda (weekday afternoon)
-	[2:00 pm]	[Pre-call technical checks]
-	2:30 pm	Start call – intro from host
-	2:35 pm	Speaker 1
-	~3:05 pm	Speaker 2
-	~3:35 pm	Speaker 3
-	~4:05 pm	Open discussion forum
-	4:30 pm	Call ends

## Typical Talk Content
The talk should have a focus on technical topics of interest to the NZ ICS Cyber Security community
-	Talks should be technical in nature (not sales and marketing).  Talks about a product or service from a vendor should focus on the problems/solutions/technical capabilities.  
-	Presentations from technical personnel are welcome.  Sales and marketing presenters should have a technical background if they wish to present for the NZ ICS Cyber TN
-	Talks should have an industrial control system focus – OT security (not corporate IT/enterprise)
-	Talks about standards are welcome (e.g. VCSS-CSO, 62443) but should be technical in nature – ‘here’s how I achieved this requirement in my OT environment’.
-	To maintain non-commercial focus, please limit any ‘about company’ slides to 1 slide and spend no more than 30 seconds on this topic. Content focus should not be about your company and what your company does or sells, but about the issues and problems, etc.

## Finances:
The group is not financial and is run by volunteers.  There are no paid personnel (speakers, committee, panellist) for any events.  No speaking fees or travel costs will be paid. The annual summit is a ticketed event.  Funds from the event go towards conference costs and administrative costs for the group (Zoom/web/etc.).
