## Members
The NZ ICS Cyber TN is made up of members from across NZ (with some international members with an interest in NZ ICS/OT security).  Various backgrounds including IT, OT, and ICS professionals.  Owner/operators as well as vendors and service providers. Various industries including both critical (CNI) and non-critical industrial organisations.  Most members have a good understanding of OT principals (skip the basics).

## Call for Presenters (CFP)
Please consider presenting at the NZ ICS Cyber TN Summit 2023 if:
-	You’re in/from NZ and you’re an owner/operator/end-user technical practitioner
-	You’re an overseas practitioner and either owner/operator/end-user or service/technology provider
-	You will need to make your own way to the event in New Zealand

The talk should have a focus on pragmatic end-user topics (both technical and management focus) of interest to the NZ ICS/OT Cyber Security community
-	Talks should be solution focused in nature (not sales and marketing).  Talks about a product or service from a vendor should focus on the problems/solutions/technical capabilities.  
-	Talks should be aimed at the ‘intermediate’ ICS/OT security practitioner (~200 level).  Skip the 101/basics/’IT vs OT’.  Advanced talks welcome.
-	Presentations from technical and management personnel are welcome.  Sales and marketing presenters should have a technical background if they wish to present for the NZ ICS Cyber TN
-	Talks should have an industrial control system focus – OT security (not corporate IT/enterprise)
-	Talks about standards are welcome (e.g., VCSS-CSO, 62443) but should be solutions-focused in nature – ‘here’s how I achieved this requirement in my OT environment’ not ‘here’s info on a standard’
-	To maintain non-commercial focus, please limit any ‘about company’ slides to 1 slide and spend no more than 30 seconds on this topic. Content focus should not be about your company and what your company does or sells, but about the issues and problems, etc.

Based on past breaches of these guidelines, the NZ ICS Cyber TN committee reserve the right to review slide decks from technology/service providers BEFORE the presentation to ensure adherence to these guidelines.

## Panels
We will run a number of panels at the NZ ICS/OT Cyber Summit 2023.  Current line-up:  
**Governance**  
Facilitator: Andre from Schneider (SIN)  
- Jenni from Contact Energy
- Jonathan from Meridian
- Matthew from OMV NZ

**Defender**  
Facilitator: James from Todd (NZ)  
- Aaron from Vector
- David from PowerCo
- James from NCSC

**Technical**  
Facilitator: Michael from Fortinet (AUS)  
- Grant from Contact Energy  
- Phil from Mercury
- Gavin from Assessment+

**Afternoon Panel (Plenary)**  
Facilitator: Peter from SGS ECL (NZ)  
- Andre from Schneider
- James from Todd
- Michael from Fortinet

In July, the facilitator will run an online call (Teams or Zoom) for the panel to meet, break the ice, discuss the panel, set expectations for the panel, etc.  This is not expected to be a ‘dry run’.
The panels are expected to run for ~45 minutes starting with opening remarks from the facilitator and introductions.  To get started, the facilitator is expected to ask a few opening questions before opening up questions from the summit participants (audience).  It is expected that the panel will be at least ~50% audience-driven – the question-list will not be fixed.

There will be a few controls to manage oversharing and reduce risk exposure to panellists (especially those representing end-user owner/operator organisations):
-	NZ ICS/OT Cyber Summit 2023 is a closed-door in-person only event
- The NZ ICS Cyber TN reserves the right to validate ticket holders to ensure the summit can be a trust-worthy environment
-	The experienced panel facilitators are not expected to put panellists in a position where they have the potential to create unnecessary risk for their organisation (e.g., through oversharing)
-	Panellists have the right to refuse to answer any question and/or limit responses as they see fit
-	All panellists are experienced security practitioners and are expected to have the good judgement required to manage risk for the organisation they represent
 
## Round Tables
We will run a number of round tables at the NZ ICS/OT Cyber Summit 2023.  Current line-up:
-	SANS ICS CC1 – ICS Incident Response: Peter from SGS ECL (NZ)
-	SANS ICS CC2 – Defensible Architecture: Rowan from Dragos (AUS)
-	SANS ICS CC3 – ICS Network Monitoring: Phil from Mercury (NZ)
-	SANS ICS CC4 – Secure Remote Access:	Matthew from OMV (NZ)
-	SANS ICS CC5 – Risk-based Vuln Mgmt:	Asaf from Schneider (AUS)

-	Safety + Security Risk: Paul from SGS ECL (NZ)
-	Water ICS/OT Network Security: tbc

If you would like to run a round-table and/or have a topic to suggest, please email summit@icscyber.org.nz 

The round table facilitator is expected to lead an informal open discussion session with ~up to 15 NZ ICS/OT Cyber Summit 2023 participants.  There is no specific format expected.  There are no expectations apart from creating a space for constructive discussion.  There will be no reporting back to anyone.  Once the round table finishes, all attendees will head to afternoon tea and the facilitator obligations will end.
The intent is to build the community defence through (appropriate) sharing and create connections in the NZ ICS/OT security community, leveraging from international experience where possible.

## Finances
Speakers, committee members, panellists, facilitators, and supporting personnel are not paid and support the NZ ICT/OT Cyber Summit 2023 as volunteers.  Speaking fees or travel costs will not be paid.
The annual summit is a ticketed event.  Funds from the event go towards event costs as well as administrative costs for the group.
